Rough Notes on Trends: (Canada Overall)

- Parks: Very large increases across entire sample window particularly beginning around May (except mild decrease during stricter quarantines in April)
- Grocery/Pharmacy: Interesting sharp increase around March 13th - tied to any key dates? Otherwise, generally small decreases until mid-June and then roughly "back to normal".
- Transit: Strong decreases ~40-60%
- Retail/Recreation: Strong decreases ~15-50%
- Workplaces: Strong decreases ~30-60%
- Residential: Increases ~20-30%

- Transit and Workplaces follow moderate up-and-down pattern due to weekends. Residential follows inverse of this. Parks follow similar, but more nuanced pattern as more people visit them towards the end of the week.

- As noted in grocery/pharmacy, there definitely seems to be more extreme changes in certain date ranges. Probably due to holidays. For example, April 10 (Good Friday), May 18 (Victoria Day), July 1 (Canada Day), August 3 (Civic Holiday nationally - BC Day for us), September 7 (Labour Day), and October 12 (Thanksgiving) have sharp changes.

- Note: BC phases were.. phase 1 March 17 (Approx.) to May 18, May 19 to June 23, and June 24 onwards.

Ideas:

- The last two notes can certainly be highlighted in the calendar heatmap vis. Particularly if we can allow comparisons.
